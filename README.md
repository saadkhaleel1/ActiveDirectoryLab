<h1>Active Home Directory Lab </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I used PowerShell and virtual machines to create a simulated company setup. I built this by scripting the creation of different virtual machines to represent various parts of a company's network â€“ servers, workstations, and more. Within these virtual machines, I crafted a company structure: I made fake user accounts, set up groups, established file directories, and connected everything to mimic a real company environment. The goal was to replicate how a company network functions, like setting up Active Directory, creating shared folders, and granting permissions between different parts of the setup. Finally, I documented every step I took to create this network simulation
